# Return Value Optimization (RVO) and Named Return Value Optimization (NRVO)

Return Value Optimization (RVO) and Named Return Value Optimization (NRVO) are compiler optimizations that eliminate unnecessary copying and creation of temporary objects when a function returns an object.

Let's understand RVO and NRVO in more detail:

## **Return Value Optimization (RVO)**

RVO is an optimization technique that involves eliminating the temporary object created to hold a function's return value. Here is an example without RVO:

```cpp
class MyObject {
public:
    MyObject(int x) : x_(x) {}
private:
    int x_;
};

MyObject CreateObject() {
    return MyObject(10);
}

int main() {
    MyObject obj = CreateObject();
    return 0;
}
```

Without RVO, the `CreateObject()` function creates a temporary `MyObject` that is then used to copy-construct `obj` in the `main()` function. **This involves potentially unnecessary overhead from creating and destroying the temporary object, as well as from the copy operation.**

With RVO, the compiler is allowed to construct the return value directly in the memory allocated for `obj`, thus avoiding the need to create a temporary object and copy it.

## **Named Return Value Optimization (NRVO)**

NRVO is an extension of RVO that applies when the function's return value is a named object. Here is an example:

```cpp
class MyObject {
public:
    MyObject(int x) : x_(x) {}
private:
    int x_;
};

MyObject CreateObject() {
    MyObject result(10);
    // Some other operations on result...
    return result;
}

int main() {
    MyObject obj = CreateObject();
    return 0;
}
```

Without NRVO, the `CreateObject()` function would create `result`, and then a copy of `result` would be made to serve as the function's return value. This copy would then be used to copy-construct `obj` in `main()`, and then it would be destroyed.

**With NRVO, the compiler is allowed to construct `result` directly in the memory allocated for `obj`, thus avoiding the need for a copy and a temporary object.** Instead, the named object `result` in the function `CreateObject()` and the object `obj` in `main()` become the same object.

It's important to note that while RVO and NRVO are widely supported and generally reliable, they are not required by the C++ standard (as of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021), meaning that it's ultimately up to the compiler whether to apply these optimizations or not. However, almost all modern compilers support these optimizations and apply them where possible to improve performance.
