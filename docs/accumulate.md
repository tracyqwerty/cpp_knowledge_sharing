# `std::accumulate`

`std::accumulate` is a function provided by the C++ Standard Library that performs a left fold operation over a range of elements. In simpler terms, it "accumulates" a value over a range of elements.

Here's a basic example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    int sum = std::accumulate(numbers.begin(), numbers.end(), 0);
    std::cout << "The sum is: " << sum << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `std::accumulate` starts with an initial value of `0` (the third argument) and adds each element in the range `[numbers.begin(), numbers.end())` to it. The result is the sum of all the elements in the vector.

`std::accumulate` is more powerful than just summing numbers, though. You can provide a binary function as a fourth argument to perform different operations. The binary function takes two arguments: the accumulated value and the current element.

Here's an example that multiplies all the numbers in a vector:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    int product = std::accumulate(numbers.begin(), numbers.end(), 1, std::multiplies<int>());
    std::cout << "The product is: " << product << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `std::accumulate` starts with an initial value of `1` and multiplies each element in the range `[numbers.begin(), numbers.end())` to it. The result is the product of all the elements in the vector. The `std::multiplies<int>()` is a predefined function object (also known as a functor) that multiplies two integers.
