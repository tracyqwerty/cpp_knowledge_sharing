# `std::count_if`

`std::count_if` is a function in the `<algorithm>` library in C++. It counts the elements in a range that satisfy a certain condition (predicate).

The function takes three arguments:

1. An iterator to the beginning of the range.
2. An iterator to the end of the range.
3. A unary predicate which returns true for the required elements.

The function applies the predicate to each element in the range and returns the count of elements for which the predicate returns true.

Here's a simple example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};

    int count = std::count_if(numbers.begin(), numbers.end(), [](int num) {
        return num % 2 == 0;  // Predicate: number is even
    });

    std::cout << "There are " << count << " even numbers in the vector.\n";

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `std::count_if` counts the number of even numbers in the `numbers` vector. The output of the program will be "There are 5 even numbers in the vector."
