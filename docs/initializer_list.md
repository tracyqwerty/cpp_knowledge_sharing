# `std::initializer_list`

Using an initializer list with your own class in C++ allows you to initialize your class objects with a list of values. This can be particularly useful for classes that represent collections or aggregate structures. To do this, you'll need to include the `<initializer_list>` header and use `std::initializer_list` in your constructor to process the list of values provided during object initialization.

Here's a basic example to illustrate how to use an initializer list with a custom class:

Let's define a simple class that will store an array of integers and use an initializer list to initialize these values.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <initializer_list>
#include <vector>

class MyClass {
private:
    std::vector<int> values;

public:
    // Constructor that takes an initializer list
    MyClass(std::initializer_list<int> initList) : values(initList) {
        std::cout << "MyClass initialized with values:";
        for (int val : values) {
            std::cout << " " << val;
        }
        std::cout << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    MyClass obj = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; // Using initializer list to initialize MyClass object
    return 0;
}
```

- **Initializer List Constructor**: The constructor of `MyClass` takes a `std::initializer_list<int>` as an argument. This allows the class to be initialized with a braced list of integers. `std::initializer_list` is a template class that represents an array of elements of type `T`.

- **Initialization in the Constructor**: Inside the constructor, we initialize the `values` member (which is a `std::vector<int>` in this example) directly with the initializer list. This is an example of member initializer list syntax, which is efficient for initializing members.

- **Printing the Values**: The constructor also contains a loop that prints the values to demonstrate how the values from the initializer list are accessed and used.

Using an initializer list in your classes makes your code more expressive and allows for easy and concise object initialization, especially when dealing with collections of values. It's also in line with modern C++ best practices that encourage the use of standard library features to write clean, efficient, and safe code.

This approach is highly flexible and can be adapted to various scenarios, not just for initializing containers but also for passing a predefined set of values to custom types, simplifying the syntax and making the initialization process more intuitive.
