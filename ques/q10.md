# What is a lambda expression under the hood?

Under the hood, a lambda expression in C++ is implemented as a functor, also known as a function object. When you define a lambda expression, the compiler automatically generates a class that overloads the function call operator (`operator()`). This class encapsulates the behavior defined in the lambda expression.

Here's a simplified explanation of how it works:

**Lambda Expression**

Consider a simple lambda expression:

```cpp
auto lambda = [](int x) { return x * x; };
```

This lambda takes an integer `x` and returns its square.

**Equivalent Functor**

The compiler translates this lambda into something conceptually similar to the following functor class:

```cpp
class LambdaEquivalent {
public:
    int operator()(int x) const {
        return x * x;
    }
};
```

Then, creating an instance of this class and using it like the lambda would look like this:

```cpp
LambdaEquivalent lambdaEquivalent;
auto result = lambdaEquivalent(5); // Equivalent to lambda(5)
```

**Capturing Variables**

For lambdas that capture variables, the generated class contains member variables corresponding to those captures. For example, a lambda capturing a variable `y` by value:

```cpp
int y = 10;
auto lambda = [y](int x) { return x + y; };
```

This would result in a generated class similar to:

```cpp
class LambdaWithCaptureEquivalent {
    int y; // Captured by value
public:
    LambdaWithCaptureEquivalent(int _y) : y(_y) {}
    int operator()(int x) const {
        return x + y;
    }
};
```

And an instance of this class would be initialized with the captured value of `y` at the point where the lambda is defined.

**`mutable` Lambdas**

If the lambda is marked as `mutable`, the `operator()` method in the generated class will not be const, allowing it to modify the captured variables (which are now class members).

```cpp
int y = 10;
auto lambda = [y](int x) mutable { y += 2; return x + y; };
```

This translates to a functor where `operator()` is not const:

```cpp
class MutableLambdaEquivalent {
    int y;
public:
    MutableLambdaEquivalent(int _y) : y(_y) {}
    int operator()(int x) {
        y += 2;
        return x + y;
    }
};
```



It'll be similar if we catch by reference:

```cpp
std::vector<int> someVec; 
int total = 0; 
std::for_each(someVec.begin(), someVec.end(),[&](int x) { total += x; });
```

```cpp
class AccumulateFunctor {
    int& total; // Reference to the total to accumulate into
public:
    AccumulateFunctor(int& total) : total(total) {}

    void operator()(int x) {
        total += x;
    }
};
```

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

// Functor definition (as above)

int main() {
    std::vector<int> someVec = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; // Example vector
    int total = 0;

    AccumulateFunctor functor(total);
    std::for_each(someVec.begin(), someVec.end(), functor);

    // At this point, 'total' will be the sum of the elements in 'someVec'
    return 0;
}
```
