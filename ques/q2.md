# `vector<string> v = str_split("1,2,3");` The memory will be where, why?

**When you create a `vector<string>` and fill it with elements, the `vector` object itself is typically allocated on the stack, but the memory for its elements is allocated on the heap.** This is because a `vector` is a dynamic data structure, meaning it can grow and shrink at runtime.

The reason why `vector` allocates its elements on the heap is because the size of the stack is much more limited compared to the heap. The stack is typically used for small objects and function call overhead, while the heap is used for larger objects or objects that need to persist for a longer time.

In your example, the `str_split` function likely creates a `vector<string>` and fills it with substrings split from the input string "1,2,3". Even though the `vector` object itself is created on the stack inside `str_split`, the actual `string` elements it holds are allocated on the heap. When `str_split` returns, it probably returns by value, and thanks to Return Value Optimization (RVO) or Named Return Value Optimization (NRVO), the `vector` is not copied, but rather the same `vector` is used in the caller's context, and thus, no extra memory allocation is done.

Therefore, when you do `vector<string> v = str_split("1,2,3");`, the `vector` `v` is on the stack, but the memory for the `string` elements it contains ("1", "2", "3") is on the heap.
