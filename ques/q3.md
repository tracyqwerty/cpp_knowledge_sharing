# Can Constructors and Destructors be virtual?

In C++, **a constructor cannot be declared as virtual.** When a constructor of a class is executed, it is with the intention of creating an instance of that class, and virtual functions are a mechanism to defer instantiation to subclasses. **When the constructor of a class is executed, there is no virtual table in the memory, which means no virtual pointer defined yet**. **Also It wouldn't make sense for a constructor to be virtual because at the time when the constructor is invoked, the class type is known.**

On the other hand, a destructor in C++ should often be declared virtual if you're designing a class to be a base class. When you delete an object through a pointer to a base class, and the base-class destructor is not virtual, the derived-class destructors are not executed, and the deletion of the object can result in undefined behavior.

Here is an example:

```cpp
class Base {
public:
    Base() { /* constructor of Base */ }
    virtual ~Base() { /* virtual destructor of Base */ }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    Derived() { /* constructor of Derived */ }
    ~Derived() { /* destructor of Derived */ }
};

int main() {
    Base* ptr = new Derived();
    delete ptr; // This calls ~Base() and then ~Derived(), because ~Base() is virtual
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, if the destructor of `Base` was not declared as virtual, only the destructor of `Base` would have been called, leading to a potential resource leak if `Derived` had allocated any dynamic memory or other resources that are freed in its destructor.

So, to summarize:

- Constructors in C++ cannot be virtual.
- Destructors should be virtual if you're designing a class to be a base class.
