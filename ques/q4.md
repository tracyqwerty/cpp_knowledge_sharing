# What is the difference between header files `#include <X.h>` and `#include <cX>`?

## Answer

The difference between headers in the form `<X.h>` and `<cX>` is related to the C and C++ standards.

- `<X.h>`: These are traditional C library headers. For example, `<math.h>`, `<stdio.h>`, `<stdlib.h>`, etc. When you include these headers in a C++ program, the functions and types they define are available in the **global namespace**.

- `<cX>`: These are the C++ versions of the C library headers. For example, `<cmath>`, `<cstdio>`, `<cstdlib>`, etc. They define the same functions and types as the corresponding C headers, but **they place them in the `std` namespace**. So for example, if you `#include <cmath>`, you should write `std::sqrt` to call the square root function, not just `sqrt`.

This means that if you're writing C++ code and you want to use a function or type from the C library, you should generally include the `<cX>` header and use the `std::` prefix. This is more consistent with the rest of the C++ standard library and helps avoid name clashes.

Another difference is that the C headers don't have overloaded versions of some functions because C does not allow function overloading.
