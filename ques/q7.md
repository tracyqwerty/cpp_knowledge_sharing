# What is the difference between 'typedef' and 'using' in C++11?

Both `typedef` and `using` are used in C++ to define type aliases, which are essentially different names by which a type can be identified. However, there are a few differences between them:

1. **Syntax**: The `typedef` keyword is inherited from C, and it uses a syntax that some find confusing. Conversely, the `using` syntax, introduced in C++11, is generally considered more straightforward.

    Here is an example of how each is used:

    ```cpp
    typedef std::vector<int> IntVector;  // typedef
    using IntVector = std::vector<int>;  // using
    ```

2. **Template Aliasing**: `using` can be used to create alias templates, which `typedef` cannot do. An alias template is a name that refers to a family of types. 

    Here's an example:

    ```cpp
    template<typename T>
    using Vec = std::vector<T>;  // Vec<int> is equivalent to std::vector<int>
    ```

3. **Scope**: In certain situations, `using` aliases can be preferable because they respect scope, while `typedef` does not. 

In summary, while `typedef` and `using` can often be used interchangeably, `using` has some advantages especially with template types and is generally considered the modern and preferred way to create type aliases in C++.

Here the examples demonstrate well the advantage of the `using` keyword introduced in C++11 over `typedef`.

In the case of `typedef`:

```cpp
template <typename T> struct whatever {};

template <typename T> struct rebind
{
  typedef whatever<T> type;
};

rebind<int>::type variable;
template <typename U> struct bar { typename rebind<U>::type _var_member; }
```

This is somewhat verbose, and the intention is not immediately clear to someone reading the code. This syntax is especially cumbersome when the `rebind` pattern is used often, such as in allocators or other parts of the C++ Standard Library.

By contrast, using the `using` keyword simplifies the code significantly:

```cpp
template <typename T> using my_type = whatever<T>;

my_type<int> variable;
template <typename U> struct baz { my_type<U> _var_member; }
```

Here, `my_type` is an alias template. This new feature in C++11 can be used to create aliases of templates, making the code more concise and readable. The code is easier to understand, and the programmer's intention is more clear.

So this is a good example where `using` provides a clear advantage over `typedef`.
