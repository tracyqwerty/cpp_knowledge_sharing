# What is string::npos in C++?

In C++, `std::string::npos` is a static member constant value with the greatest possible value for an element of type `size_t`. This value, when used as the value for a length parameter in string's member functions, means "until the end of the string".

As a return value, it is usually used to indicate no matches. For example, when used with the `std::string::find` function, if the function does not find the substring you're looking for, it will return `std::string::npos`:

```cpp
std::string s = "Hello, World!";
size_t found = s.find("Goodbye");
if (found != std::string::npos)
    std::cout << "Substring found at position: " << found << '\n';
else
    std::cout << "Substring not found\n";
```

In this case, because "Goodbye" is not a substring of "Hello, World!", `std::string::find` will return `std::string::npos`, and the program will output "Substring not found".
